  <p>If properly connected, this app records valuable data received from the diagnosis interface of your car and
      stores it on your phone  (see <i>History</i>).</p>

 <p>We kindly ask you to donate the data you collect while using LolaDrives. </p>
 <p>Donating the data enables our research team at Saarland University to perform analyses beyond individual cars,
     understand better the limitations and prospect of our work, and of course to improve the stability of the app.</p>

  <p>Your personal data is protected by the European Union's GDPR and Germany's data privacy laws. Below, you can choose
   to either accept our privacy policy and to enable data uploads, or to keep your data for yourself.</p>

      <h2 id="purpose-and-scope-of-processing-personal-data">Purpose and scope of processing personal data</h2>
      <p><strong>Data donations</strong>: Data received from the diagnosis interface of your car and location data obtained from the (GPS) location services of your mobile device are used for the purpose of academic research. The research group <em>Dependable Systems and Software</em> (for short: &quot;Depend&quot;) processes the data for the purpose of identifying car models violating emissions regulations as well as detecting the usage of systematically tampered emission cleaning systems, as those firstly discovered during the Diesel Emissions Scandal in 2015. Beyond that, the data can be used to analyse arbitrary processes inside the car (e.g., fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, ...). Our research is based on the uninterpreted received data. This data is stored without a direct relation to your name, from which your identity could be inferred. Though, certain data (e.g., vehicle identification number or location data) could possibly allow to reconstruct your identity. In any case, the analysis is about the behaviour of the car, not the driver. We will not use data donations to draw conclusion about the identity of users. In the following, we will refer to this data as <em>data donations</em>. </p>
      <p><strong>Communication Data</strong>: During transmission of data to our servers, additional data is collected and processed due to technical reasons and to prevent abusive use of our data storage server. In the following, we will refer to this data as <em>communication data</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Analysis Results</strong>: Data donations can be analysed for research purposes as explained above. The result of such analyses is an aggregation of multiple data sets, hence it is fully anonymous and does not contain any individual-related data. As analysis results do not contain personal data, the GDPR does not apply to this data. Analysis results may be published as scientific contributions world-wide and indefinitely. In the following, we will refer to this aggregated data as <strong>analysis results</strong>.</p>
      <h2 id="legal-basis-for-processing-personal-data">Legal basis for processing personal data</h2>
      <p><strong>Data donations</strong>: The legal basis for collecting and processing data donations is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR, i.e., the explicit consent of the user to donate data as described in this privacy statement. </p>
      <p><strong>Communication Data</strong>: The legal basis for collecting and processing communication data is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, i.e., our legitimate interests  in order to realise the data donation storage service, in particular, the functionality and security of our technical infrastructures. Communication data is not processed for any other purpose.</p>
      <h2 id="description-and-scope-of-data-processing">Description and scope of data processing</h2>
      <p><strong>Data Donations</strong>:</p>
      <ul>

              <li>Engine Speed</li>
              <li>Vehicle Speed</li>

          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>During Real Driving Emissions (RDE) tests: the data collected for vehicle monitoring, and additionally, exact location data (e.g., GPS), including speed and altitude, provided by the mobile device on which the app is used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All data collected during a single trip is merged into a single trip record file. </p>
      <p><strong>Communication Data</strong>:
          The following data is logged for every attempt to donate a file:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>Port number</li>
          <li>Date and time of access </li>
          <li>Requested URL</li>
          <li>Request method</li>
          <li>Result of the request (HTTP status code)</li>
          <li>Size of the transmitted data</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="reason-for-collecting-location-data">Reason for collecting location data</h2>
      <p>Collecting and processing location data (e.g. GPS data) is necessary to evaluate RDE tests: RDE tests are only valid if altitudes of start and end position diverge at most by a defined threshold. Moreover, the RDE regulation distinguishes between urban, rural and motorway segments. Location data is used to determine if each segment has been covered appropriately.</p>
      <h2 id="storage-location-and-erasure-of-data">Storage location and erasure of data</h2>
      <p>The personal data of the data subject are erased or blocked as soon as the reason for storing them ceases to exist. Storage beyond this time period may occur if provided for by European or national legislators in Union regulations or national legislation and rules to which the data controller is subject. Such data shall also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by one of the aforementioned legal standards expires. </p>
      <p><strong>Data donations</strong>: We store your data donations for at most 15 years, in accordance with Art. 5(1)(e) GDPR. According to Guideline 17 of the <strong>Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice</strong> of the German Research Foundation DFG (as of September 2019), it is necessary to keep the data donations for 10 years after publication of our research results derived from the donations. Prior to that it may take up to 5 years until our research results are published. Due to technical reasons, the data may persist up to 9 weeks in our backup system after erasure from the main system. Data donations are stored on servers of Universität des Saarlandes.</p>
      <p><strong>Communication Data</strong>: Communication data is stored on servers of Universität des Saarlandes and is deleted from the system in an automatised way after 14 days. </p>
      <h2 id="category-of-recipients">Category of recipients</h2>
      <p><strong>Data donations</strong>: Recipients of the data donations are trustworthy cooperating research facilities in the European Union. Currently, we have an active cooperation as part of the DFG Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 248 (CPEC), which involves:</p>
